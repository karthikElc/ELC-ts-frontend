        "knowledge": {
            "summary": "The article discusses the recent comments made by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, who advocated for a strategic decoupling from China. Tai emphasized the need for the U.S. to reduce its economic reliance on China, citing national security concerns and the need to protect American jobs and industries. She highlighted the Biden administration's focus on building resilient supply chains and diversifying trade relationships to reduce the country's dependence on China. The article also mentions the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with the two countries engaging in tariff wars and disputes over issues like intellectual property rights and market access. Tai's remarks reflect the broader shift in U.S. policy towards China, which has become increasingly confrontational under the Biden administration. The article suggests that this strategic decoupling could have significant implications for businesses and consumers, as it may lead to higher prices, supply chain disruptions, and reduced access to Chinese markets. The article is relevant to the B.Com curriculum, as it discusses international trade, economic policies, and the impact of geopolitical tensions on business operations.",
